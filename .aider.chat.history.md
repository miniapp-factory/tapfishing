#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### helps allocate budget and messaging.  
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo image you want to generate.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a budget chart and messaging bubble intertwined, rendered in a modern flat design with vibrant colors against a clean background. The chart is depicted as a rising bar graph, while the bubble represents messaging, both elements are connected by a subtle arrow to convey integration of budgeting and communication.
